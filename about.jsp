                <p>I attained my Bachelor's in Computer Information Systems with honors summa cum laude. My studies
                    concentrated around Information Assurance and Security and Systems Development, but I often find
                    myself doing more Web Development than anything else. I currently work off-campus at a local church,
                    <a href="fpcclarksville.org">First Presbyterian Church of Clarksville, TN</a> as a web developer.
